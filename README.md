# tkown
Batch script to conveniently take ownership of files via the command line
# Installation
Download the tkown.bat file from the Releases page or this repo, then put it into PATH. You can also put it into System32 or %systemroot%, that will also work.
# Usage
Open the command prompt, type in tkown and then type in the name of the file you want to take ownership of.
For example, to take ownership of notepad.exe, you'll type this:

You can also make a shortcut to tkown on the desktop or any other place and make it so that it always runs as administrator, then drag n drop that file to the shortcut.
